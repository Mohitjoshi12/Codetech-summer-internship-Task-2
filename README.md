Project 2: Development of a Real-Time Chat Application Using React and WebSockets
This project involved the development of a real-time chat application using React.js for the frontend and WebSockets (Socket.IO) for real-time bi-directional communication. The application enables users to send and receive messages instantly in a shared chat interface, simulating real-world messaging systems. Key features include real-time message broadcasting, live UI updates, and smooth user interaction. The frontend was built using modern React practices, including functional components and hooks, while WebSocket communication was implemented to handle live message transmission. The project demonstrates the ability to integrate frontend frameworks with real-time backend services, focusing on event-driven programming, state management, and responsive UI design.
